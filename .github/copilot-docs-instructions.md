# Code Documentation Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for generating documentation in our Angular and Nest.js project. It focuses on using TSDoc effectively, ensuring consistency across the codebase, and helping developers maintain high-quality documentation.

---

## 1. Overview

Our goal is to create clear, consistent, and maintainable documentation in English. We use [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) as our standard for inline documentation in TypeScript files, ensuring that both the Angular and Nest.js sections of our codebase are well documented.

## 2. TSDoc Guidelines

### 2.1. Basic TSDoc Syntax
- **Block Comments:** Use `/** ... */` for documenting modules, functions, classes, and properties.
- **Single-Line Comments:** Use `//` for brief notes outside of TSDoc blocks.

### 2.2. TSDoc Tags

Use the following common TSDoc tags:
- **`@param`** – Document function parameters.
- **`@returns`** – Describe the return value of a function.
- **`@remarks`** – Provide additional information or clarifications.
- **`@example`** – This tag may be used for code samples, but in our documentation guidelines we recommend keeping examples to a minimum.
- **`@deprecated`** – Mark outdated items and describe the recommended alternatives.

### 2.3. Detailed Documentation

- **Classes & Interfaces:**  
  Provide an introductory comment that explains their purpose, key properties, and intended usage.
  
- **Methods & Functions:**  
  Clearly document parameters, return values, and any potential edge cases.
  
- **Properties:**  
  Describe each property's role, type, and format expectations.

### 2.4. Consistency and Clarity

- **Uniformity:**  
  Apply the same documentation style for similar components across the project.
- **Accuracy:**  
  Keep documentation updated with changes in the code.
- **Clarity:**  
  Write in straightforward, plain English.
- **Formatting:**  
  Utilize Markdown formatting in TSDoc comments where applicable to highlight code or important points.

## 3. Angular-Specific Guidelines

Given the nature of Angular projects, the following practices should be adhered to when documenting Angular code:

### 3.1. Components
- **Purpose and Role:**  
  Clearly describe the component's role within the UI and its interactions with other components.
- **Template Bindings:**  
  Document any critical bindings or template references.
- **Lifecycle Hooks:**  
  Explain the rationale behind any custom logic in lifecycle methods.

### 3.2. Services
- **Responsibilities:**  
  Describe what the service does, such as data handling or state management.
- **Methods:**  
  Document how the service communicates with APIs, including error handling and any caching strategies.

### 3.3. Modules & Routing
- **Module Overview:**  
  Explain the purpose of the module and list the included components, directives, and services.
- **Routing Details:**  
  Include inline comments for any non-trivial routing decisions or configurations.

## 4. Nest.js-Specific Guidelines

Nest.js adopts a modular pattern, so documentation here focuses on controllers, providers, interceptors, and modules.

### 4.1. Controllers
- **API Endpoints:**  
  Document each endpoint by specifying the HTTP method, route path, and the expected request/response structure.
- **Security:**  
  Clearly state any authentication or authorization requirements.

### 4.2. Providers/Services
- **Service Functions:**  
  Explain what each service handles, such as business logic or integration.
- **Dependency Management:**  
  Document any dependencies and their roles within the service.

### 4.3. Modules
- **Overview:**  
  Provide a high-level summary of the module's purpose, the controllers it contains, and the services it provides.
- **Global Configuration:**  
  Highlight special configurations for modules that are applied across the application.

### 4.4. Guards, Interceptors, and Pipes
- **Purpose:**  
  Describe the need for the guard, interceptor, or pipe.
- **Implementation Details:**  
  Outline the logic behind handling requests or responses as necessary.

## 5. Documentation Generation and Maintenance

### 5.1. Automatic Documentation Generation
- **Tools:**  
  Utilize tools such as [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/) to generate HTML documentation from TSDoc comments.
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  Integrate the documentation generation process into the CI/CD pipeline to maintain up-to-date docs.

### 5.2. Code Reviews and Documentation
- **Review Process:**  
  Include documentation as part of code reviews, ensuring changes in functionality are reflected in the comments.
- **Ongoing Audits:**  
  Regularly review and update documentation to remove outdated information and improve clarity.

### 5.3. Versioning
- **Change Logs:**  
  Maintain a log for documentation changes.
- **Deprecation:**  
  Use the `@deprecated` tag to clearly mark obsolete components and suggest alternative approaches.

## 6. Additional Tips

- **Simplicity:**  
  Avoid overly complex explanations; clear and concise documentation is key.
- **Minimal Examples:**  
  Use code examples sparingly to avoid cluttering the documentation.
- **Collaboration:**  
  Foster a collaborative documentation process where all team members contribute to improvements.
- **Consistent Style:**  
  Adhere to a consistent style guideline to ensure uniformity across the entire codebase.
