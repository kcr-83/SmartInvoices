# Deduplication Refactor

Your goal is to identify duplicate logic across the file and refactor it into a single reusable helper function.

## Requirements

- Scan the file for repeated code blocks or logic.
- Extract the duplicated logic into a well-named helper function.
- Show an example of how to use the new helper in place of the duplicated code.
- Use TSDoc comments for the helper function.

## Output

- Provide the full refactored code block.
- Include a brief explanation of the changes and the purpose of the helper function.
- Ensure the refactored code is ready to paste into the original file.
