# Extract Function Refactor

Your goal is to refactor the highlighted code by extracting self-contained logic into separate, pure functions.

## Requirements

- Identify logical blocks that can be separated.
- Extract each into a new function:
  - Each function must be â‰¤ 15 lines.
  - Each function must be pure (no hidden mutations or side effects).
  - Use [Project Naming Guideline](../project-naming-guideline.md)
- Do not include unrelated code or blank lines within functions.
- Return only the new code, ready to paste.
