# Bug and Security Vulnerability Scan

Your goal is to analyze the file for potential bugs and security vulnerabilities, providing appropriate fixes.

## Requirements

- Scan the file for potential bugs such as:
  - Null or undefined reference errors
  - Off-by-one errors in loops or array operations
  - Memory leaks or resource handling issues
  - Race conditions in asynchronous code
  - Type inconsistencies

- Identify security vulnerabilities including:
  - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, command)
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) opportunities
  - Insecure data handling or storage
  - Authentication or authorization weaknesses
  - Insecure direct object references
  - Broken access control
  - Missing input validation or sanitization

- For each identified issue:
  - Explain the problem and its potential impact
  - Provide a tested, comprehensive fix
  - Use modern TypeScript/JavaScript security best practices

## Output

- List each identified issue with:
  - Issue description and risk assessment
  - Code snippet showing the problematic code
  - Refactored code with the fix implemented
  - Explanation of how the fix addresses the issue

- Prioritize issues based on severity:
  - Critical: Immediate security threats
  - High: Bugs that will cause errors
  - Medium: Potential problems that could manifest under certain conditions
  - Low: Code smells or minor improvement opportunities
